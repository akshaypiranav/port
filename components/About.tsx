                Iâ€™m a Cyber Security-driven SDE Intern with a year of experience at Quarksek Technologies, where I contributed to the development of security-focused tools and process automation. Working alongside senior security engineers and penetration testers, I gained hands-on exposure to real-world security challenges and solutions. My role bridged software development and offensive security, allowing me to support secure system design and improve operational efficiency. I'm now looking to transition into a Cybersecurity Engineer role where I can continue strengthening infrastructure and driving security improvements.
