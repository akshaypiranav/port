                I am Akshay Piranav, a final year BTech student at Kamaraj College of Engineering and Technology with a focus on web development. Passionate about creating dynamic web applications, I specialize in Node.js and Python for both front-end and back-end development. I follow Agile development practices, which allow me to deliver high-quality, iterative solutions efficiently. Agile methodologies help me collaborate effectively, adapt to changing requirements, and continuously improve my work. As I complete my degree, I am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting, contribute to innovative projects, and grow as a full stack web developer.
